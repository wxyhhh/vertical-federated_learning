# vertical-federated_learning
An implementation of vertical federated learning

This project implemented a simple vertical federated learning architecture. The vertical federated learning means that parties have common
id space but have different features.(for example: a bank and a e-commerce company) One party will keep the labels while the others keep 
their data of different features.
